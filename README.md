# Nathan's Site 
This is a simple react+github-pages project to serve as a personal website for my resume and a whatever else I feel like adding in. It can be viewed live here: https://www.enphnt.github.io/.

## How to work on this one:

1. Check out `develop` branch
2. Work on some issue/feature 
3. Commit your work on `develop`
4. Push the commits: `git push origin develop`

## How to Deploy

Deployment use `gh-pages` and currently just pushes latest bundle to `master`. TODO: improve the messages of each deployment.

1. To deploy, `npm run deploy`. On success, you should see the message 'Published'. 
2. Verify the update works as expected on https://www.enphnt.github.io/
