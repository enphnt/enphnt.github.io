    "bio":"I write mainly JavaScript code for end to end and integration tests. However, to make continuous testing a reality I leverage js to create needed tooling and infrastructure. To pun it lightly, I'm a jack of all trades and a master of test. In addition to performing and writing tests, I help to create procedures that give teams transparent actionable feedback to expose risk early and build confidence with every build.",
