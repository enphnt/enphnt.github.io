# Alright, Alright, Alright
This collection consists of contemporary and classic songs that feature the word "alright" in the lyrics. 

For some reason, this word is encountered a lot in popular lyrics. Some suspect a conspiracy around the [overuse](https://www.lyrics.com/lyrics/alright) of this word. Others think it's just a coincidence. 

I'll let you decide.
