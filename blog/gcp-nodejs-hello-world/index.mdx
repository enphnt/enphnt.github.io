So, it's the first step in any new development environment: HELLO WORLD! ðŸ™Œ

Deploying a node.js app on GCP standard environment is actually incredibly easy.

## Prereq steps:
1. Installed and initiallized `gcloud`
1. Successful login to gcloud
1. Billing is enabled on your gcloud account ðŸ¤‘
1. Have a node.js app that runs :)
1. Enabled the [Cloud Build API](https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=cloudbuild.googleapis.com)

## Steps to Deploy:
1. Create the Project - via the terminal with 
    ```

    gcloud app create --project=[PROJECT_ID]


    ```

1. Go to the node.js code directory or clone the google example: 
    ```

    git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/nodejs-docs-samples


    ```

1. Navigate to the Hello World app: 
    ```

    cd nodejs-docs-samples/appengine/hello-world/standard


    ```

1. Install and Run the app locally: 
    ```

    npm install && npm start


    ```

1. Deploy the app! - from the same root directory of the app, run: 
    ```

    gcloud app deploy
    

    ``` 
    then follow the prompts to select region, etc.

1. View the app once it finished deploying: 
    ```

      gcloud app browse
      
    ```

![gcloud-app-browse](./gcloud-app-browse.png)
<br/>
<div className={note}>
  <strong>Note:</strong> The default location for a deployment is: 
    ```
    
    https://PROJECT_ID.REGION_ID.r.appspot.com
    
    
    ```
   So you can either navigate there in your browser or, alternatively, you can use: 
    ```
    
    gcloud app browse
    
    
    ```
   The `app browse` arguments will prompt the shell to trigger the browser and open the page open for you.

And you are done! Yes, it was actually that easy. Now, lets look into some additional features/capabilities of GCP + Node.js, like [GCP Datastore](../gcp-datastore/).
