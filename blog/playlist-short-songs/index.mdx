# I'll keep it brief!
These short songs are from all kinds of artists and genres. If you have a short attention span, this playlist is for you.

Some of my personal favorite tracks are:
- **Thundercat - I Am Crazy**: What an amazing bass player. This song is a short self-reflection that I can relate to. 
- **The Beatles - Her Majesty**: A short and sweet song that was originally meant to be part of the [Abbey Road medley (aka 'The Long One')](https://beatles.fandom.com/wiki/The_Long_One).
- **The White Stripes - Little Room**: A short song about the importance of having a little room to yourself.
- **About - Give It a Rest**: a twitchy acoustic track from Dutch artist Jason Forrest, somehow gets stuck in my head despite being so short.

# Thanks for listening
Hope you enjoyed those tiny tracks! You can add the playlist to your collection on Spotify, Youtube or Apple Music. 

I'm already working on a v2 of short songs. So many more to add!
