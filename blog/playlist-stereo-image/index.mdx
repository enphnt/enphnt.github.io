# About the Playlist
This playlist is all about highlighting songs with great use of stereo image. Big sounds and interesting recording and production techniques are abundant. 

Stereo imaging is the process of creating width, depth, and the perception of locality in a music mix. It is used to create a sense of space for the listener. When audio engineers mix a music track in stereo; instrumentals and vocals are layered at different output levels to the left and right channels to create a sense of width, depth and even height.

In pop and psychedelic music, stereo imaging can be used to create a sense of movement or motion in the music by panning sounds back and forth between left and right channels. In recording and producing music, stereo imaging can be used to create a sense of space by placing instruments at different locations within the stereo field. This can help create a more immersive listening experience for the listener.

Some of the songs on this list,  I've heard, can be useful for testing a sound system. Sound engineers use reference tracks to adjust their ears to new environments and to adjust equipment to improve the overall sound.
