# Stereo Imaging
This playlist is all about highlighting songs with great use of stereo image. Big sounds and interesting recording and production techniques are abundant. 

Stereo imaging is the process of creating width, depth, and the perception of locality in a music mix. It is used to create a sense of space for the listener. When audio engineers mix a music track in stereo; instrumentals and vocals are layered at different output levels to the left and right channels to create a sense of width, depth and even height.

  title="You Never Give Me Your Money / The End - Tenacious D"
  height="300"
/>

There are some other notable covers of The Beatles - The End, just like alot of their tracks, some of them are from: [Phil Collins](https://youtu.be/SgoQ1gi_7i0) and [Neil Diamond](https://youtu.be/t8d7SDR_6Uw).

The song uses balanced panning to create a sense of space and clarity between different elements of the music, such as the piano, guitar, vocals, drums, bass, and orchestral instruments. The stereo imaging of the song showcases the Beatles' recording techniques in this recording, such as using:
- automatic double tracking (ADT) to create a fuller and richer vocal sound.
- direct injection (DI) to record the bass guitar directly into the mixing console, bypassing the amplifier and microphone.
- tape loops and vari-speed to create the orchestral effects and timpani sounds.
- close miking and compression to capture the drum sound.
- overdubbing and editing to create the seamless transition between the solos.
