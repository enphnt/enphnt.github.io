This will be quick! Well, I guess that depends on your connection.

## Current Support

While its currently only an [experimental feature](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/NetworkInformation/downlink), there is actually a handy way to check your internet connection speed directly in the browser. No, you don't need to navigate to a 'speed-test' site.

At the moment, both Chrome and Edge browsers have enabled this capability by default but, for now, Firefox only works if you manually enable (as of FF 90).

## Test downlink speed via the browser

So if you are on Chrome or Edge, open the console and type the following:

```

navigator.connection.downlink


```
<br />
For example, in my current location, I was able to see that my internet downlink speed currently sits at 1.6Mbps:
